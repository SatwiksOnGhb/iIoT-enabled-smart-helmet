# iIoT-enabled-smart-helmet


This project presents an Arduino-based Smart Mining Helmet designed to enhance worker safety in underground mining environments. Mining operations often expose workers to hazardous gases such as carbon monoxide and methane, extreme temperatures, high humidity, and poor visibility. Traditional safety gear does not provide real-time alerts or environmental monitoring. To address this gap, the helmet integrates multiple low-cost sensors including MQ-135 and MQ-7 for gas detection, DHT11 for temperature and humidity, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and an IR sensor for helmet-wear and motion tracking. These sensors continuously measure environmental conditions and compare them against predefined safety thresholds.

When any parameter crosses a dangerous limit—such as high CO levels, extreme heat, or nearby obstacles—the system immediately activates alerts using a buzzer and LEDs. All sensor data is processed by an Arduino Uno, which acts as the central controller. The prototype was tested under simulated hazardous conditions, including exposure to smoke, elevated temperature, and close-range obstacles. The system responded reliably, triggering alerts without false positives under normal conditions. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using embedded systems and IIoT-ready hardware for real-time hazard detection in mining.

Overall, the Smart Mining Helmet provides a low-cost, scalable solution for improving underground safety. While the current version is a standalone prototype, it is designed for future upgrades such as wireless communication, rechargeable power, and data visualization dashboards. This makes the system suitable not only for academic research but also as a foundation for next-generation industrial safety equipment.
